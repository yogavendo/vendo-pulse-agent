# 🚀 Vendo Pulse Agent

A lightweight peer monitoring and observability agent built on Intercom infrastructure.

Built by: @yogavendo  
Forked from: Trac-Systems/intercom

---

## 🧠 Overview

Vendo Pulse Agent introduces a monitoring layer designed to observe peer activity and simulate network health diagnostics within an Intercom-based decentralized environment.

This project focuses on peer observability rather than governance mechanisms.

---

## 🛠 Contribution Scope

This fork extends the Intercom peer stack by introducing:

- Monitoring simulation engine
- Peer health evaluation logic
- Active node tracking
- Average latency calculation
- CLI-based diagnostics

---

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone repository:

git clone https://github.com/yogavendo/vendo-pulse-agent.git

Navigate to agent directory:

cd vendo-pulse-agent
cd agent

Run the agent:

node index.js
